Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a medical condition that affects the eyes and is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. It is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina due to high blood sugar levels in diabetic patients. Early detection is crucial for preventing further complications, and deep learning techniques, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown great promise in automating the detection and grading of diabetic retinopathy from retinal images.
